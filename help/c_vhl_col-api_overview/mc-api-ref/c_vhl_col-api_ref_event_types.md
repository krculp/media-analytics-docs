# Event Types and Descriptions


* ** ` sessionStart`** - Sent with the ` sessions` call. When the response returns, you extract the Session ID from the Location header and use it for subsequent event calls to the Collection server.
* ** ` play`** - Sent when the player changes state to "playing" from another state (i.e., the ` on('Playing')` callback is triggered by the player). Other states from which the player moves to "playing" include "buffering", the user resumed from "paused", the player recovered from an error, autoplay, and so on.
* ** ` ping`:** 
    * **Main Content** - Must be sent every 10 seconds during main content playback, regardless of other API events that have been sent. The first ping event should fire 10 seconds after main content playback has begun.
    * **Ad Content** - Must be sent every 1 second during ad tracking.
  Ping events should *not* include the ` params` map in the request body.

* ** ` bufferStart`** - Sent when buffering starts. There is no ` bufferResume` event type. A bufferResume is inferred when you send a ` play` event after ` bufferStart`.
* ** ` pauseStart`** - Sent when the user presses Pause. There is no ` resume` event type. A resume is inferred when you send a ` play` event after a ` pauseStart`.
* ** ` adBreakStart`** - Signals the start of an ad break
* ** ` adStart`** - Signals the start of an ad
* ** ` adComplete`** - Signals the completion of an ad break
* ** ` adSkip`** - Signals an ad skip
* ** ` adBreakComplete`** - Signals the completion of an ad break
* ** ` chapterStart`** - Signals the start of a chapter segment
* ** ` chapterSkip`** - Signals a chapter skip
* ** ` chapterComplete`** - Signals the completion of a chapter
* ** ` sessionEnd`** - This is used to notify the VA backend to immediately close the session when the user has abandoned viewing the content and is unlikely to returnIf you don't send a ` sessionEnd`, an abandoned session will time-out normally (after no events are received for 10 minutes, or when no playhead movement occurs for 30 minutes), and the session is deleted by the backend)

* ** ` sessionComplete`** - Sent when the end of the main content is reached
