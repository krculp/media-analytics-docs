# Video Milestone Implementation (Old)

The Milestone model allows a completely custom implementation where customers can decide when and how frequently to send in server calls during playback. It was called "Milestone" because the most common implementations sent in server calls at the start, 25%, 50%, 75%, and at the completion of the video. The solution uses your own custom eVars and events to track video by using Adobe's Media Module. The Heartbeats solution was designed to build upon some of the limitations of Milestones, specifically around providing more granularity and accuracy around engagement and to provide a more standardized measurement solution across our entire customer base.

The Milestone model can be used at the same time as the Heartbeats model in a specific report suite, but both solutions should not be used at the same time in the same player. Data captured from both models can live and be reported on in the same report suite. This will allow you to gradually migrate to the Heartbeats model without having to update everything at the same time.
