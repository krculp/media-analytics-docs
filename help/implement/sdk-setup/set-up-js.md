# Set up JavaScript


* **Obtain valid configuration parameters for Heartbeats** - These parameters can be obtained from an Adobe representative after you set up your video analytics account.
* **Implement ` AppMeasurement` for JavaScript in your video application** - For more information about the Adobe Mobile SDK documentation, see [ Implementing Analytics Using JavaScript ](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/implement/js_implementation.html).
* **Provide the following capabilities in your media player:** 
    * *An API to subscribe to player events* - The media heartbeat requires that you call a set of simple APIs when events occur in your player.
    * *An API that provides player information* - This information includes details such as the media name and the play head position.


1. Add your [ downloaded ](../../implement/download-sdks.md#section_551A10AD7880426BB29AE52482BB4211) library to your project. Create local references to the classes for convenience.
    
    1. Expand the ` VideoHeartbeatLibrary-js-v2.*.zip` file that you downloaded.
    1. Verify that the ` VideoHeartbeat.min.js` file exists in the ` libs` directory:
    1. Host the [!DNL  VideoHeartbeat.min.js] file. This core JavaScript file must be hosted on a web server that is accessible to all pages on your site. You need the path to these files for the next step. 

    1. Reference [!DNL  VideoHeartbeat.min.js] on all site pages. Include ` VideoHeartbeat` for JavaScript by adding the following line of code in the ` <head>` or ` <body>` tag on each page. For example:     
       ```
       <script type="text/javascript" 
       src="http://INSERT-DOMAIN-AND-PATH-TO-CODE-HERE/VideoHeartbeat.min.js"></script>
       ```


    1. To quickly verify that the ` VideoHeartbeat` library was successfully imported, instantiate the ` ADB.va.MediaHeartbeatConfig` class.

       >[!NOTE]
       >
       >From Version 2.1.0, the JavaScript SDK is compliant with the AMD and CommonJS module specifications, and [!DNL  VideoHeartbeat.min.js] can also be used with compatible module loaders. 
    
1. For easy access to the APIs, create local references to the ` MediaHeartbeat` classes.

   ```
   js   var MediaHeartbeat = ADB.va.MediaHeartbeat; 
   var MediaHeartbeatConfig = ADB.va.MediaHeartbeatConfig; 
   var MediaHeartbeatDelegate = ADB.va.MediaHeartbeatDelegate; 
   
   ```

1. Create a ` MediaHeartbeatConfig` instance.
   This section helps you to understand ` MediaHeartbeat` config parameters and how to set correct config values on your ` MediaHeartbeat` instance, for accurate tracking. 



   Here is a sample ` MediaHeartbeatConfig` initialization: 


   ```
   js   //Media Heartbeat initialization 
   var mediaConfig = new MediaHeartbeatConfig(); 
   mediaConfig.trackingServer = Configuration.HEARTBEAT.TRACKING_SERVER; 
   mediaConfig.playerName = Configuration.PLAYER.NAME; 
   mediaConfig.channel = Configuration.HEARTBEAT.CHANNEL; 
   mediaConfig.debugLogging = true; 
   mediaConfig.appVersion = Configuration.HEARTBEAT.SDK; 
   mediaConfig.ssl = false; 
   mediaConfig.ovp = Configuration.HEARTBEAT.OVP; 
   
   ```


1. Implement the ` MediaHeartbeatDelegate` protocol.

   ```
   js   var mediaDelegate = new MediaHeartbeatDelegate(); 
    
   // Replace <currentPlaybackTime> with the video player current playback time 
   mediaDelegate.getCurrentPlaybackTime = function() { 
       return <currentPlaybackTime>; 
   }; 
    
   // Replace <bitrate>, <startuptime>, <fps> and <droppeFrames> with the current playback QoS values.  
   mediaDelegate.getQoSObject = function() { 
       return MediaHeartbeat.createQoSObject(<bitrate>, <startuptime>, <fps>, <droppedFrames>); 
   };
   ```


1. Create the ` MediaHeartbeat` instance.
   Use the ` MediaHeartbeatConfig` and ` MediaHeartbeatDelegate` to create the ` MediaHeartbeat` instance. 

   ```
   js   this.mediaHeartbeat = new MediaHeartbeat(mediaDelegate, mediaConfig, appMeasurement);
   ```

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >
   >Make sure that your ` MediaHeartbeat` instance is accessible and does not get deallocated until the end of the video session. This instance will be used for all of the following video tracking events. 

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >` MediaHeartbeat` requires an instance of ` AppMeasurement` to send calls to Adobe Analytics. Here is an example of an ` AppMeasurement` instance: 

   >
   >```
   >js   >// AppMeasurement instance example 
   >var appMeasurement = new AppMeasurement(); 
   >appMeasurement.visitor = visitor; 
   >appMeasurement.trackingServer = "<visitor_namespace>.sc.omtrdc.net"; 
   >appMeasurement.account = <rsid>; 
   >appMeasurement.pageName = <page_name>; 
   >appMeasurement.charSet = "UTFÂ­8";
   >```
