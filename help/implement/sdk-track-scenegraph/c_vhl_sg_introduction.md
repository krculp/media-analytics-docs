# Introduction

Roku has introduced a new programming framework for developing applications: the SceneGraph XML programming framework. This new framework features two new key concepts:


* SceneGraph rendering of the application screens
* XML configuration of the SceneGraph screens


The Adobe Mobile SDK for Roku is written in BrightScript. The SDK uses many components that are not available for an app running on SceneGraph (for example, threads). Therefore, a Roku app developer intending to use the SceneGraph framework cannot call Adobe Mobile SDK APIs (the latter are similar to those available in legacy BrightScript apps).
