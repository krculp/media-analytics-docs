                      "id": "videoconcurrentviewers",
                      "top": 2880
                  }

          }
      }
      
      ```



      >[!TIP]
      >
      >Some sessions are ended on the next day, and at that point the data will be available for reporting. In that case the best approach is to select 2 days (2880 minutes) of data, and use only the data for the first day (1440 minutes).
