# Federated Analytics

The Federated Analytics service provides a system for sharing Adobe Video Analytics data between two partners. The standardized video measurement data created by Adobe Video Analytics is the hallmark for Federated Analytics, allowing the same data to flow into a single report from multiple sources. Through the rules and logic governing Federated Analytics, data is easily controlled and individualized to meet the needs of each partnership. Federated Analytics makes video measurement more efficient, streamlined, and actionable.

* **Video Analytics Implementation: **The Sender must have video analytics implemented on all players that will be part of the federated data set. Only Video Analytics data is available for federation. See documentation: [ https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/appmeasurement/hbvideo/](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/appmeasurement/hbvideo/)
* **Adobe Consulting Contract: **For initial set-up of federated rules between receiver and sender it is valuable to work with consulting services to review data and create the data sharing agreement.
