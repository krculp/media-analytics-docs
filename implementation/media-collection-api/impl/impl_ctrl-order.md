# **Controlling the Order of Events**

Since the VA API is RESTful, and video tracking is a highly time-dependent
operation, an implementor could be concerned about VA API tracking calls
arriving at the back end out of order. The back end _does_ attempt to queue up
and reorder events based on the provided timestamp in the playerTime object.
However, there is a limit to this capability. Currently, the reorder may fail
if the delays between out of order calls are more than one second. This
"acceptable delay time" may be optimized and / or be configurable in future
updates.
