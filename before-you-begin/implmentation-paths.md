# Implementation Paths

## Client Side

These are Video Analytics-only integrations. You can go with the Video Heartbeat SDK and/or the Media Collection API integrations. This path can be used across any video player, including customer and/or OVP players such as Brightcove, Ooyala, thePlatform, and so on. 

If Video Analytics is your intended path, see the [VA SDK Implementation](add_link.md) and the [Media Collection API](add_link.md). To use Video Analytics, customers must also use Adobe Analytics. 

## Adobe Launch

Adobe Launch, the follow-on product to Dynamic Tag Management, features a Video Analytics Launch Extension that facilitates implementing video tracking in your players. You can learn more about VA Launch here: [VA Launch Extension Docs](https://docs.adobelaunch.com/extension-reference/adobe-analytics-for-video-extension).
